# Android-Score-Keeping-App


This app tracks the score for Cricket.
The 2 text boxes for Runs show the score for Team A and team B. To update the score, user has to select the runs scored by the batsman from the radio group and then click the + and - buttons as required. There is option to add pitch runs(1,2,3) and boundaries(4,6).
There can not be negative runs, so if the user tries to decrease runs below 0, App wouldn’t allow.

At the bottom, wickets for both teams are displayed. When the game starts, both teams have 10 wickets each. User can click the - button to decrease when a batsman is declared OUT. The wickets also can’t be negative, so App wouldn’t allow the user to decrease beyond 0.

The ‘Start New Game’ button can be used to reset the score and start fresh.
